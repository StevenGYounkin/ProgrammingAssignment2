## Here I create two functions, makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve, that cache the 
## inverse of a matrix. 
##
## makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix" that can cache its inverse. 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}

## cacheSolve computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatix. If the inverse has already been calcluated, and the matrix 
## has not changed, then cacheSolve retrieves the inverse from the cache
## 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
